TODO list for development of Petri net in MPS
- improve manual
  - MOF diagram for structure
- distribute some samples with the plugin (and refer in manual)
- find a real external Petrinet tool for the text generation (and put into manual)
- sort between manual and README
- Could try to run build after generating CUP/FLEX: Make/Rebuild to get build script generated, use IMakeService and MakeSession.
    You may find examples in MPS codebase, e.g. MakeActionImpl in jetbrains.mps.ide.make solution.
- build debugger for Petri net runtime (debug language) - compare with Eclipse CDT bridge, WatchProviderContext, IDebugStrategy
  - Debugger = abstract exec engine (set breakpoint, step, run), in transformation: also translate debug info (if exec)
  - debugger.steps: single, into, out, watch (value)
  - stack frames? define by structure of statements
  - watches: hide system-level variables?
--> It depends on whether you are generating BaseLanguage or not. With the Java debugger being embedded in MPS a BaseLanguage-targeting language is easy to support debugging for. Otherwise you need to implement integration with the debugger of the platform that you are generating into. More on the topic can be found at https://www.jetbrains.com/help/mps/2020.3/debugger.html
- add possibility to comment lines
- handle that the same place could appear twice in transition in or out (in execution)
- test references outside the petri net (when there are two Petrinets, they should not be able to see each other)
- find better way for project path than absolute path in file->settings->path variables
- remove all warnings and notifications
- create unit tests for the parser
- create unit tests for text generation
- make TODO items into issues
